# My-SuMo-Questions
_Page that polls Mozilla Support API for updates to threads you've participated in_

If you are not an active contributor on the Mozilla Support "Questions" forum, this will not be of much interest to you.

To see this code in action: https://www.jeffersonscher.com/sumo/myq.html

* myq.html - main page
* pref.html - set preferences for myq.html

Bonus files not related to the above (but I serve them from the same folder):

* extensions.php - demonstrates the AMO search API and additional useful information it makes available
* extensionslist.html - uses the AMO search API to build a page listing details on the user's extensions (pasted from the Extensions table on the Troubleshooting Information page, AKA about:support)
